# Weather query Tool
  This is the 3rd experiment of the course Experiments of Network at Nanjing University. It's a reverse engineering example, in which I build up the client by catching data packages via wireshark when running director's client. On the basis of anlyzing these data packages, I am capable of developing a similar tool to query weather condition in specified city from the very server.  
  In this tool, TCP connection is set during the whole qeury process. However, I take a leave to doubt its efficience. In my opinion, such kind of simple interaction shall better complished through UDP rather than TCP. Anyway, this is just a student experiment not a practical tool.
